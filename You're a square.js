// You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!
// However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vain… Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.
// Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number

var isSquare = function(n){
    for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
      if (i*i === n) return true
    }
    return false
  }
